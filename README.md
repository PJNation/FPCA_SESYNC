Food prices is an indicator of food security because they affect affordability and nutritional choices. This repo was created to implement analyses of data from the pilot project "Food Price Crowdsourcing in Africa (FPCA)", as part of SESYNC Workshop. The goal is to understand spatial and temporal changes in commodity food price along the value-chain.

## The Team
The team is comprised of researchers from International Institute of Tropical Agriculture - IITA
Julius Adewopo (Geodata Scientist|Project Lead)

Helen Peter (Research Supervisor)


## The Data
Commodity Food Price data were acquired through crowdsourcing from volunteers who spontenously submitted observed georeference price data from various markets on a daily basis, since Sept. 2018.
